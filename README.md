# Reproducibility study of tumor lesion features in [68Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT scans

Results of PSMA radiomics reproducibility


The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of radiomic features extracted from lesions identified in consecutive [68Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT images of prostate cancer patients.

For this study, radiomic features were extracted with “pyradiomics”, an open-source python package in compliance with Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI). The statistical analysis was performed on the software IBM SPSS Statistics. Reproducibility was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as a measure of agreement.

The attached file has the complete reproducibility results of all 106 radiomic features.
